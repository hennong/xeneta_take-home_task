# xeneta_take-home_task

My solution to the take-home task by Xeneta.

## Instructions

Add the x-api-key key to the Config.ts (in src/Api) and then run "yarn/npm run webpack" to build the project. After that you can start the application with "yarn/npm start".

##  Details

It took me a bit more than 5 hours (including planning and researching technologies) to finish this task.
The only thing that I struggled with was Chartjs (the technology I used to display the Data). It is way easier to use than d3js but getting the hang of it and learning to display the data the way I want to, was still time consuming. Everything else was fine though.
